\section{Introduction}
	With the ever increasing availability of high resolution three-dimensional scanning and geographic information science software, new methods of lithic morphometric research are rapidly become both possible and practical. If it is truly the goal of the archaeologist to thoroughly and accurately record as much information as possible about their findings, then adopting these methods will soon become the new standard. Utilizing these technological resources, researchers at Oregon State University have developed GLiMR: GIS-based Lithic Morphometric Research. This software utilizes a number of ArcGIS tools to generate a large set of morphometric data which can also later be used for high resolution characterizations, analysis, and comparisons of artifact form.
	This research will use three dimensional digital scanning and GLiMR to examine an assemblage of lithic artifacts from the Pilcher Creek site. This assemblage includes complete projectile points of varying styles, as well as projectile point fragments, bifaces, and other miscellaneous lithic objects. The projectile points fall mostly into two different classifications, including stemmed and lanceolate forms. The benefit of performing this analysis is that a large number of morphometric measurements can be taken, which would be prohibitively time consuming to obtain by hand. These measurements can then be used to validate the original classification, possibly find new classifications, and allow for rapid comparison with assemblages from other sites.
